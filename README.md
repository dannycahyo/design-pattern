# Design Patterns Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing and learning various design patterns in software development. Each pattern is implemented in JavaScript and includes examples and explanations.

## Design Patterns Included

- Proxy Pattern: A proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object for another object. It controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
- Singleton Pattern: A singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- Observer Pattern: An observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
